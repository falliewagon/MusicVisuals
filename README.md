# Description of the assignment
The song i decided to choose was Yofukashino Uta by Creepy Nuts as i believe it tells a great story about how bad worklife in japan truly is. To help with the flow i decided to implement a counter system so that each of my visuals would be times rather than having to account for human error with a button press.

# Instructions
When you run the program if you want to make it play you just press the spacebar like it says on the screen.

# Clarity
I would just like to take a second to elaborate on what the video as a whole is supposed to be saying. The main idea is that its supposed to simulate the experience of a person living in japan who has just joined the work force and for the first time is seeing what the night life has to offer. Try to put yourself into the shoes of a man who has just left a life of education and finished his first 8 - 12 hour office job shift and is going out with co workers to a bar where they'll drink the night away.

The name of the song in english is "Call of the night" and it begins with low tones as if you're a person leaving an office building and slowly getting accustomed to the bright lights and loud noises of a night in tokyo, my first visual i believe does a good job of this so i named it BlurredVision.

The second visual is named CrowdAnxiety as you've just now realised how many people their are around you that seem like blank canvases that tell no story, they move so fast as if they all know where they're going but your simply being dragged along through the busy streets by co workers you barely know. This is shortly followed by a colour change as the man gets closer towards the bar he sees drunkards passed out on the sides of the roads in expensive looking suits similar to your own.

My third visual is named DrunkenSpiral, as the man sits down with his new acquaintances the tone shifts to a more laid back yet upbeat vibe in which they all encourage or pressure him into joining them in drinking their sorrows away while they complain about their lives. The spiral expands to show the man getting more hallucinagetic with every pint he finishes until he finally goes over his limit and the world around seems as if its moving without him.

The final visual, called JoyfulIgnorance, is an attempt as showing the man coming to terms with his new life as he finally understands why the drunkards he saw on the floor previously do this every night. The man has become one of those faces in the crowd that on lookers laugh at during the night but hes become so intoxicated that all he sees are the other men passed out alongside him.

# How it works


# What I am most proud of in the assignment
The creation of the counter mechanic was very satisfying for me as the end result didnt require me having to click a button to change the visual each time. I also believe that my visual was able to tell a good story that aligns with the message that Creepy Nuts attempted to recreate in their song.
